        New Era greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

I believe the impact of Operation by All Means shall continue to speak louder than ever in this Commission, resulting in the kind of growth that we have never seen nor heard of till date. At the same time, there shall be diverse change of story order of testimonies in the lives of every Winner that engaged in one way or another in this operation, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. What then is the Holy Ghost saying for the Month of August 2025?We discover from scriptures that most sicknesses and diseases are direct oppressions of the devil – `Luk. 13:11-13/ Act 19:11-12`. For instance, we saw how satan smote Job with boils, which many take as an ordinary natural occurrence – `Job. 2:7`. We saw how Jesus rebuked fever from Peter’s mother-in-law, and she was made whole `– Mat. 8:14-15`. We also saw a woman that was bent all over for 18 years and Jesus loosed her from that captivity. That was not just a spinal issue after all, but a satanic oppression `– Luk. 13:11-16`. Jesus gave His disciples power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases and with that they went forth healing everywhere `– Luk. 9:1-6/ Mat. 10:1`. This must be the reason some sicknesses are dubbed incurable by medical experts, but Jesus went about healing all manner of sicknesses and diseases, casting out evil spirits with His Word `– Mat. 4:23/ Mat. 8:16/ Act 10:38`. All the above is why we need the understanding of our weapons of warfare, so as to ward off all satanic assaults on our health. These spiritual weapons may not appear as tangible, but their impact cannot be denied `– 1 Sam. 17:32-50/ 2 Cor. 10:3-6/ Eph. 6:12`. Among the spiritual forces available to us include, the healing Virtue in the Word, the force of faith, the Name of Jesus, Anointing Oil, Holy Communion, Prophetic mantle, e.t.c. All through this month of August, God shall be visiting us to terminate every diseases including terminal and incurable diseases, and deliver everyone appointed to death by restoring the health of every single Winner. For with our God, nothing is impossible, and all things are possible to him that believes – `Mat. 9:27-29/ Psa. 102:20/ Mak. 9:23`
