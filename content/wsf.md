## Creating A Forum For A Caring Christian Fellowship

**Acts 2:46 (King James Version KJV)** <br>

::alert{type="example" icon="lucide:lightbulb"}
  And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.
::


The advent of megachurches and the busyness of the times have resulted in a church with faceless members where people are being taught but not being touched. The Church has consequently become a large ocean with drowning members.

### The Winners Satellite Fellowship (WSF) 

The WSF is set to create a forum for a caring fellowship where every member of the Church is adequately cared for. **We are the Church in The Home!** We:
 - Fellowship together
 - Pray together
 - Search the scriptures together
 - Share the love of God together as a family.
