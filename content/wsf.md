## Creating A Forum For A Caring Christian Fellowship

**Acts 2:46 (King James Version KJV)** `And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.`

The advent of megachurches and the busyness of the times have resulted in a church with faceless members where people are being taught but not being touched. The Church has consequently become a large ocean with drowning members.

**The Winners Satellite Fellowship (WSF)** is set to create a forum for a caring fellowship where every member of the Church is adequately cared for.
