  Blood Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension & Hepatitis Humiliated

  #content
  In may 2012, the devil struck and I was almost gone, if not for my wife who was around. When we got to the hospital, the doctor said I had cancer of the blood, diabetes, hypertension and hepatitis B. I keyed into Pastor Faith Oyedepo's book, Rescued from Destruction. Now I am whole! I can walk, I sleep well and I drove myself to church! I give praise to God!

  Testimonies Galore!

  #description
  I thank God for delivering me

  #content
  In 2010, before I joined this Commission, I used to smoke, drink alcohol and I had been eating in the dream. I started listening to God's word from the mouth of the Bishop, and putting them to work. Lo and behold, God surprised me! He delivered me from smoking and drinking!

#title
Why we share testimonies

#content
- We share testimonies with other people on how God turned our situations around. Testimony is an acknowledgement of the faithfulness of God and a form of bearing witness, praise and honour to our Lord Jesus Christ.

- We also use it as a way to encourage others, that the same God that intervened in our lives can do so for you and others. Every time you overcome trials and tribulations in life, is an opportunity to share a testimony of how God worked in your life and made you stronger.
