Why we share your testimonies

#description
- We share your testimonies with other people on how God turned your situation around. Testimony is an acknowledgement of the faithfulness of God and a form of bearing witness, praise and honour to Jesus Christ.

- We also use it as a way to encourage others, that the same God that intervene in your life can do so for them. Know every time you overcome trials and sufferings in life, thatâ€™s an opportunity to share a testimony of how God worked in your life and made you stronger.
